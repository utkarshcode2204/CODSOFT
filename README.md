# CODSOFT Internship Tasks - C++ Programming

This repository contains the C++ programming tasks completed as part of my internship with **CodSoft**. Each task is implemented using core C++ concepts, demonstrating both functional logic and clean code practices.

## 🧠 Overview

As part of the internship, I was assigned the following three tasks:

1. **Simple Calculator**  
2. **Tic Tac Toe Game**  
3. **To-Do List Application**

Each task has its own folder in this repository with the source code and relevant instructions.
